# The Croquet Microverse Assets Repository

## Description

The Croquet Microverse worlds created by the Croquet Corporation uses some 3D models and skybox images as assets. A Microverse world may load an assets from the Croquet file server by a Croquet dataId and that is in general preferable, sometimes a developer may use an example as their starting point, or keep the file locally to minimize dependency to the file server during development. This repository keeps those asset files used by the example worlds.
